# 100 Days of Code

For a while, I've tried to stick to the 100 day's project, but usually 
find myself failing to follow through within a week or two. 
Been reflecting on the reason and understood that scattering myself around
different resources and not having a solid plan was the issue. 

So here's my attempt to rectify that and actually having content folder for 
the practices being done. 

This project file has been forked from the official repository of the challenge 
made by [kallaway](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code) if you'd like to start 
your own challenge. 

Bellow will have the plan that will be updated as I move on and progress.

The aim is to bring back the love to program that has been long lost. 

## Action Plan 

My main focus is to develope my frontend skills along with picking up the JS stack. 
The detailed logging of the days will be documented [here](./logs/log.md)
I plan on working throw 3 different sources. 

* [Wes Boss's courses](https://wesbos.com/courses/)
* [Colt Steele's courses](https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/)
* [Stephen Grider's courses](https://www.udemy.com/user/sgslo/)

Will start it off, with Wes's courses first and then move on. 
first class will tackle is:
