### R1D1: November 22 Thursday

I had to re-start my 100 days challenge since I missed a week. This time it's more about consistincy than perfection.
Today I went throught [Wes Bos's commanline Power User Course](https://commandlinepoweruser.com/) and read a couple of posts on the commandline. It was nice practice not to mention that my terminal looks cool now :)
