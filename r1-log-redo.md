## Log

### R1D1: December 1 Saterday

For the first day, I wanted a bit of refresher on a couple of topics to get on and start coding again. Since I'll be focusing on Front-end development. I started with a HTML refresher. I used a video tutoorial by freecodecamp called [Learn HTML5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPnqb74Smug) To be hinest I wasn't suspecting to learn new info, but I did such as the `mark` tag what adds highlight to your text, the `pre` tag that ads the format you make to your content such as indentation also the `q` tag that gives quote to your text. All in all I believe I covered what I need in regards to HTML5

### R1D2: December 2 Sunday

Today is CSS revision day. So these three days will be all about revision before jumping into the Wes Bos courses. Today I went over the [CSS Crash Course](https://youtu.be/yfoY53QXEnI) and revisited a couple of CSS concepts

### R1D3: December 3 Monday

Today is JS revision day. As I've said I have a couple of things to touch on and today was JS day. I went over the course [Javascript Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEROU2XtPR8). Also, I went over a video that discusses GraphQL [What is GraphQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7giZGFDGnkc)

_thoughts_ Tomorrow is the day we get started with a Wes Bos course. I'll start with Reatc!

### R1D4: December 4 Tuseday

Today is quite nice! I finally started the Wes Bos course 'React for Begginers' and also acompanying it with the 'React for visial Learners' blog. So off to a nice start. Also went over the project 'Creating a bookmark using JS' and that was a lovely learning experience that covered `localStorage` so nice day with JS 

### R1D5: December 5 Wednesday

We're starting to touch the surface of React! Okay covered three main topic from Wes's course which are `JSX`, importing CSS, and the overall layout of a reach app. So far so good. I also finished up chapter 2 of the React for visual learnins, and concluded te day with a filtering challenge using pure vanilla JS.

### R1D6: December 6 Thursday

React is slowly making sence and to be honest Wes is a great instructor!  okay so topday I couvered `props` in react apps and learned that you can pass other than just strings. Also learned about the diffrence between statfull and statless compnenets, and mos importantly I learned about `routes` in react. I also went over chapter 3 of the ['Raect for Visual Learners'](https://medium.com/coding-artist/react-js-for-the-visual-learner-chapter-3-building-our-houses-295c43304b18) course and manages to do two pens.
