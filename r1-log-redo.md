## Log

### R1D1: December 1 Saterday

For the first day, I wanted a bit of refresher on a couple of topics to get on and start coding again. Since I'll be focusing on Front-end development. I started with a HTML refresher. I used a video tutoorial by freecodecamp called [Learn HTML5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPnqb74Smug) To be hinest I wasn't suspecting to learn new info, but I did such as the `mark` tag what adds highlight to your text, the `pre` tag that ads the format you make to your content such as indentation also the `q` tag that gives quote to your text. All in all I believe I covered what I need in regards to HTML5

### R1D2: December 2 Sunday

Today is CSS revision day. So these three days will be all about revision before jumping into the Wes Bos courses. Today I went over the [CSS Crash Course](https://youtu.be/yfoY53QXEnI) and revisited a couple of CSS concepts

### R1D3: December 3 Monday

Today is JS revision day. As I've said I have a couple of things to touch on and today was JS day. I went over the course [Javascript Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEROU2XtPR8). Also, I went over a video that discusses GraphQL [What is GraphQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7giZGFDGnkc)
