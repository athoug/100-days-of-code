## Log

### R1D1: December 1 Saterday

For the first day, I wanted a bit of refresher on a couple of topics to get on and start coding again. Since I'll be focusing on Front-end development. I started with a HTML refresher. I used a video tutoorial by freecodecamp called [Learn HTML5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPnqb74Smug) To be hinest I wasn't suspecting to learn new info, but I did such as the `mark` tag what adds highlight to your text, the `pre` tag that ads the format you make to your content such as indentation also the `q` tag that gives quote to your text. All in all I believe I covered what I need in regards to HTML5

### R1D2: December 2 Sunday

Today is CSS revision day. So these three days will be all about revision before jumping into the Wes Bos courses. Today I went over the [CSS Crash Course](https://youtu.be/yfoY53QXEnI) and revisited a couple of CSS concepts

### R1D3: December 3 Monday

Today is JS revision day. As I've said I have a couple of things to touch on and today was JS day. I went over the course [Javascript Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEROU2XtPR8). Also, I went over a video that discusses GraphQL [What is GraphQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7giZGFDGnkc)

_thoughts_ Tomorrow is the day we get started with a Wes Bos course. I'll start with Reatc!

### R1D4: December 4 Tuseday

Today is quite nice! I finally started the Wes Bos course 'React for Begginers' and also acompanying it with the 'React for visial Learners' blog. So off to a nice start. Also went over the project 'Creating a bookmark using JS' and that was a lovely learning experience that covered `localStorage` so nice day with JS 

### R1D5: December 5 Wednesday

We're starting to touch the surface of React! Okay covered three main topic from Wes's course which are `JSX`, importing CSS, and the overall layout of a reach app. So far so good. I also finished up chapter 2 of the React for visual learnins, and concluded te day with a filtering challenge using pure vanilla JS.

### R1D6: December 6 Thursday

React is slowly making sence and to be honest Wes is a great instructor!  okay so topday I couvered `props` in react apps and learned that you can pass other than just strings. Also learned about the diffrence between statfull and statless compnenets, and mos importantly I learned about `routes` in react. I also went over chapter 3 of the ['Raect for Visual Learners'](https://medium.com/coding-artist/react-js-for-the-visual-learner-chapter-3-building-our-houses-295c43304b18) course and manages to do two pens.

I also went over teh vanilla Javascript tutorials this project was about weight conversions.

### R1D7: December 7 Friday

Another day anotehr dab at Rect. Today was a nice learning experience. I learned about helper functions and importing and exporting functions. I also learned about how events are handled in react anf binding `this` (with the diffrnet bind approaches) I also learned about refrnecing elements in react and using them. Not to mention how you inheart from the router it's methods [if the componenet is imported there] and having access to the `history` prop. I alo went over chapter 4 of the ['React for visual Learners'](https://medium.com/coding-artist/react-js-for-the-visual-learner-chapter-4-our-first-village-8b44427d4762) course.

finally another vanilla JS course and this time covers the DOM. The interesting bit is learning the diffrence between `textContent` and `innerText` one ignores style rules while the other doesn't

### R1D8: December 8 Saturday

Today is a slow day, becaue if I learned anything from the first round before this is not to overwhelm myself which in turn causes me to burnout so went over the React course and coverd teh concept of states. I do believe I got a grasp on it but I think I'll go over it again tomorrow since it's one of teh basics. But all in all a nie day

### R1D9: December 9 Sunday

Today covered or rather revisited the state topic in the Wes Bos couse 'React For Begginers' and understood how it is the single source of truth [data container] in a react application. understood how to pass it and it's updateing functions into othe components [using props] also how to initialize and update states. Also covered how to render a list of components in JSX. Then i moved on to the 'React for Visual Learners' course and only covered props.

I also continued with the [Vanilla JS Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK2cBMcDTss&index=7&list=PLillGF-RfqbbnEGy3ROiLWk7JMCuSyQtX) and today was more DOM elements. Selecting using parent, child, siblings properties, and also covered creating elements from the DOM
