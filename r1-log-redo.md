### R1D1: December 1 Thursday

For the first day, I wanted a bit of refresher on a couple of topics to get on and start coding again. Since I'll be focusing on Front-end development. I started with a HTML refresher. I used a video tutoorial by freecodecamp called [Learn HTML5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPnqb74Smug) To be hinest I wasn't suspecting to learn new info, but I did such as the `mark` tag what adds highlight to your text, the `pre` tag that ads the format you make to your content such as indentation also the `q` tag that gives quote to your text. All in all I believe I covered what I need in regards to HTML5
