## Log

### R1D1: December 1 Sunday

Started the Beginner JS course. Started with module 1 [1-5]. A detailed of what I worked on can be found [here](https://github.com/athoug/100-days-of-code/tree/master/Content/Beginner%20Javascript/Module-1)
Also, I wanted to get back to designing using CSS. So I did this design called [loading...](https://codepen.io/athoug/pen/PowYVme) Where I hope this projects ignites my love for programming again.

### R1D2: December 2 Sunday

Contined today the Beginner JS course, with module 1 [6-8]. A detailed of what I worked on can be found [here](https://github.com/athoug/100-days-of-code/tree/master/Content/Beginner%20Javascript/Module-1). It was quite interesting because I learned why programing languages don't do accurate decimal addition

[Why 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004](https://0.30000000000000004.com/)

Also, learned how to add back ticks  `` ` ` `` [into markdown!!](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/82718/how-do-i-escape-a-backtick-within-in-line-code-in-markdown)
