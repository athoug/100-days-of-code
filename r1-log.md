In this journy, I aim to become a frontend developer. I'm already inrolled in Udacity's nanodegree and went over the first two sections that covered html syntax, and practice.
In addition, I'm suplemnting my learning with [shay Howe's](https://learn.shayhowe.com/) website that teached html & css frinished the first lesson there and covered common terms and browser rests.

also practiced some CSS Images. Here's a link to the work

### R1D4: March 12 Tuesday

It's all about responsive design today. So I went over two modules in the front-end degree that discussed "why responsivness" and "starting small". I also got my code review for the project and never have I felt this happy! The comments were amazing and so encouraging.
I also went over the "getting to know CSS" chapter of [shay Howe's](https://learn.shayhowe.com/) website. 
I just need to remind myself slow and steady wins be pacient.
