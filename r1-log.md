## Log

### R1D1: August 27 Monday
Started The react course. First did a refresher on JS ES6 and ES7. worked on a couple of code examples [here's a link to the examples](https://github.com/athoug/Learning-React/tree/master/Udemy-React%2016/1-next-jen-javascript)

Then learned how to make pure CSS images, which helped me add a project to my 180 day challenge.

Today was a heaft day. Managed to cover alot. Started off by reading the MDN docs for teh Array object and it's associated methods from `map()`, `'reduce()`, `filter()`..etc Managed to put in some practuice alog the way. [Here's a link to the repo of practice files](https://github.com/athoug/Learning-React/tree/master/Udemy-React%2016/1-next-jen-javascript)

Then moved on to more Pure CSS images. This time it was a bit challengeing but rewarding none the less. It contributed to the 180 day challenge.

### R1D3: August 29 2018
Today can count as a reading marathon. I went over the MDN doc and read quite a few articles, and did the practice that was provided along the day. 

I also explored CSS variables, and did my 180-day project based on it/ Basically thinking about things as components. This project centered around buttons and their colors to which variables were used.

**_toughts_** Honestly today I felt a tad overwhelmed. I kept thinking of where I am and the amount of articles, courses, and information I need to go over to build the projects in my head. It dawned on me how close i am to the starting point rather than the finish line. I was supposed to go over React but decided otherwise because I already passed the hour mark. And any more time will just cause me to burnout to which i do not want to happen. I hope this overwhelming feeling would stop at somepoint in the future. 

### R1D4: August 30 2018
It's all about CSS variables today. Worked on my 180 day project that changes themes night/day. The functionality works and all, but the layout and responsivness is still iffy. I need to work on those. 

**link to work** [CSS Variables | Theme Repo](https://github.com/athoug/180-websites-project/tree/master/day68)

**_toughts_** Today I felt a bit bumbed out because I couldn't manage to figure out the layout and spent hours debugining to no prevail. It's one of those moment of frustrations programmers run into when debugging. But hey I shouldn't forget that i managed to get it to work though right?  

### R1D5: August 31 2018
Started with an intro to React. Understood the basic elements of a react app, then moved on to continue working on the theme project. I managed to position them right! 

**link to work** [CSS Variables | Theme](https://athoug.xyz/day68/index.html)

**_toughts_** I realized, I am using way to many resources which causes me to feel overwhelmed. Decided to focuse on a couple of resources and slowly move up. 

### R1D6: September 1 2018
This was a react day. worked more on react regarding components and re-using them. I also got to know props, child elements, and states.

### R1D7: September 2 2018
Today centered around CSS variables again. Used them on a project that dynamicly changes the color of a cube based on user input. This was part of the 180 day challenge where I did a pixel heart users can change it's percpective and colors

**_toughts_** This project reminded me of how much i enjoyed coding before and how fun the process what. Does this mean the fun is back now?

### R1D8: September 3 2018
It is all about React today. I managed to finish the course section about basic react syntax. I also did the assignment and with not a problem at all! I read through som e resources which is basically the react docs. I also followed a Medium article that sums up react. So pretty satisfied with how much I managed to consume and work on today

I also worked on some CSS today. I covered the `z-index` and `@media` for responsovness. I wanted to contribute to the 180 day challeneg so I did a pure CSS image of a pizza. it was fun. I also went over previouse projects to fix their responsivness.

**_toughts_** Today is a good day :)

### R1D9: September 4 2018
Another React day. Spent today working on lists and conditionals. I won't lie I faced a lot of stumps during the assignment, but those stumps mad overcoming them that much more rewarding. I think i'm slowly getting the hand of things, or perhaps it's just my imagination anyways it's good.

### R1D10: September 5 2018
Since I've been focusing on React recently, I wanted to make sure that I've been grasphing the topic and not just following along the course, SO I focused todays 180-project on React. A simple app that states reasons to be happy and allows users to enter their own.

**link to Work** [Happiness Reasons](https://athoug.xyz/day70/index.html)

I also worked on responsive design by using CSS `@media` to fix some issues with previous code.

I also worked went over the webdev bootcamp course and did the sections assignment.

**_toughts_** To be honest, I was about to cop out from creating a rocket from scratch in CSS and just convert the sketch image to an svg and just animate that, but then that beats the point of practicing CSS so yeah I soldiered on and started drawing with CSS. [so proud that I did that] :)

### R1D12: September 7 2018
Today I worked on the [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs) tutorial.
