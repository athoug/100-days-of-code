## Log

### R1D1: February 10 Sunday
In the quest to becoming Frontend developer I've gone through a couple of practices today. 
* React course: where I went over Debugging the app and different ways of detecting errors.
* HTML and CSS Book: where I covered different Markup tags [chapter 8] from Doctype, block and inline elements, containers such as div's and span's, meta tags, and escape characters
