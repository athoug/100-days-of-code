## Log

### R1D1: August 27 Monday
Started The react course. First did a refresher on JS ES6 and ES7. worked on a couple of code examples [here's a link to the examples](https://github.com/athoug/Learning-React/tree/master/Udemy-React%2016/1-next-jen-javascript)

Then learned how to make pure CSS images, which helped me add a project to my 180 day challenge.

Today was a heaft day. Managed to cover alot. Started off by reading the MDN docs for teh Array object and it's associated methods from `map()`, `'reduce()`, `filter()`..etc Managed to put in some practuice alog the way. [Here's a link to the repo of practice files](https://github.com/athoug/Learning-React/tree/master/Udemy-React%2016/1-next-jen-javascript)

Then moved on to more Pure CSS images. This time it was a bit challengeing but rewarding none the less. It contributed to the 180 day challenge.

### R1D3: August 29 2018
Today can count as a reading marathon. I went over the MDN doc and read quite a few articles, and did the practice that was provided along the day. 

I also explored CSS variables, and did my 180-day project based on it/ Basically thinking about things as components. This project centered around buttons and their colors to which variables were used.

**_toughts_** Honestly today I felt a tad overwhelmed. I kept thinking of where I am and the amount of articles, courses, and information I need to go over to build the projects in my head. It dawned on me how close i am to the starting point rather than the finish line. I was supposed to go over React but decided otherwise because I already passed the hour mark. And any more time will just cause me to burnout to which i do not want to happen. I hope this overwhelming feeling would stop at somepoint in the future. 

### R1D4: August 30 2018
It's all about CSS variables today. Worked on my 180 day project that changes themes night/day. The functionality works and all, but the layout and responsivness is still iffy. I need to work on those.

**_toughts_** Today I felt a bit bumbed out because I couldn't manage to figure out the layout and spent hours debugining to no prevail. It's one of those moment of frustrations programmers run into when debugging. But hey I shouldn't forget that i managed to get it to work though right?  

### R1D5: August 31 2018
Started with an intro to React. Understood the basic elements of a react app, then moved on to continue working on the theme project. I managed to position them right!

**_toughts_** I realized, I am using way to many resources which causes me to feel overwhelmed. Decided to focuse on a couple of resources and slowly move up. 

### R1D6: September 1 2018
This was a react day. worked more on react regarding components and re-using them. I also got to know props, child elements, and states.

### R1D7: September 2 2018
Today centered around CSS variables again. Used them on a project that dynamicly changes the color of a cube based on user input. This was part of the 180 day challenge where I did a pixel heart users can change it's percpective and colors

**_toughts_** This project reminded me of how much i enjoyed coding before and how fun the process what. Does this mean the fun is back now?
